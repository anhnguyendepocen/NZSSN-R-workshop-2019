## Session goals

- More data analysis in **R**:

    + Simple linear regression
    + Simple logistic regression

- Short wrap-up.

# Linear regression

## Simple linear regression in **R**

We can perform a simple linear regression in **R** using the `lm` function.

Generalized **R** code:

```
lm(y ~ x, data = dataset.df)
```

- `y`: the continuous response variable.
- `x`: the continuous explanatory variable.
- `dataset.df`: name of the dataframe containing the variables.

> Does the change in Total score influence the change in age of the subjects?

## Visualize the relationship

```{r, out.height = 500, out.width = 500}
plot(total ~ age, data = issp.df)
```

## Visualize with `ggplot` {data-transition="zoom-in none-out"}

We can visualize the relationship using `ggplot` as `geom_smooth(method = "lm")` gives you the fitted line of the simple linear regression!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(issp.df, aes(age, total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "black", se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))
```

## Visualize with `ggplot` {data-transition="zoom-out none-in"}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(issp.df, aes(age, total)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = "black", se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))
```

## Simple linear regression in **R**

```{r}
my_slr = lm(total ~ age, data = issp.df)

summary(my_slr)
```

## Conclusion 

- The linear relationship between age and total score is statistically signifcant.
- Total score is positively related to age.

## Multiple linear regression in **R**

- We can include more explanatory variables into a model.
- We still use the `lm` function.
- We need to know the structure of the model:

    + Interaction terms
    + Additive terms

Generalized **R** code (example):

```
lm(y ~ x1 + x2 * x3 + x4, data = dataset.df)
```

# Logistic regression

## Simple logistic regression in **R**

We can perform a simple logistic regression in **R** using the `glm` function.

Generalized **R** code:

```
glm(y ~ x, data = dataset.df)
```

- `y`: binary response variable (i.e. TRUE or FALSE).
- `x`: the explanatory variable.
- `dataset.df`: name of the dataframe containing the variables.

> Does age influence the probability of chosing the `being obedient' in preparing for children for life?

## Response variable

- The response variable in a logistic regression is binary.
- To answer this question, we need to transform our variable:

> ... q5 == "be obedient"

```{r}
issp.df$be_obedient = issp.df$q5 == "be obedient"
```


## Simple logistic regression in **R**

```{r}
my_slgr = glm(be_obedient ~ age, data = issp.df, family = binomial)

summary(my_slgr)
```

## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(my_slgr)$coef
```

```{r}
(exp(0.006166452) - 1) * 100
```

We estimate that for every one year increase in age, the probability of chosing the `being obedient' increased by 0.6185%.  

## Prediction from the model

```{r}
# Logit scale, usually referred to as the linear predictor scale
lp <- predict(my_slgr, data.frame(age = 50))
lp

exp(lp)
```

> Interpretation: A 50-year old is 0.22 times likely to consider being obedient important preparation for life than thinking for oneself. Or, a 50-year old is 4.55 times more likely to thinking for oneself than being obedient.

## Prediction from the model

```{r}
#Probability scale
predict(my_slgr, data.frame(age = 50), type = "response")
```

> Interpretation: The probability that a 50-year old considers being obedient important preparation for life is 0.1794.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(model = c( "**Simple linear regression**",
                    "**Simple logistic regression**"),
           fun = c("`lm(y ~ x, data = dataset.df)`",
                   "`glm(y ~ x, data = dataset.df, family = binomial)`")) %>%
  kable(format = "html",
        col.names = c("Model", "Generalized code"))

# Wrap-up

## Work flow

This workshop has covered most of what is required for a typical scientific analysis project:

- Initiate an RStudio project (session 1)
- Ensure you format your data correctly (session 1)
- Read the data into **R** (session 1)
- Clean your data (session 2)
- Factor in your data (session 3)
- Join two datasets (session 3)
- Summarize (session 4)
- Plot (sessions 5 & 6)
- Analyze (session 7 & 8)

All conducted within a well-organised directory, with transparency and reproducibility at every step.
