```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = "#R: ")

gw = getwd()
setwd("../../../")
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
setwd(gw)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

For these exercises we will be using the `sports.df` data set again. Run the following lines to ensure you're up to date from the previous exercises:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
library(ggplot2)
```


# 1. Linear regression

We will use the `sports.df` data set to conduct a simple linear regression to answer the 
following research question:

> "Is the subject's age associated with their average score?"

Note that in this scenario, we have one continuous response variable (`average`), and one continuous explanatory variable (`age`). Note that response variables should always be plotted on the y-axis, and the explanatory variable on the x-axis.

1. Plot the data using a scatter plot in base **R**. Are there any outliers?

```{r}
plot(average ~ age, sports.df)
```

2. Create the same scatter plot using `ggplot` and add the linear regression line. Are you expecting a significant result?

```{r}
ggplot(sports.df, aes(age, average)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

3. Conduct a simple linear regression and interpret the results. Include the confidence intervals of the coefficients using `confint()` function.

```{r}
average_lm = lm(average ~ age, data = sports.df)
summary(average_lm)
confint(average_lm)

# We have no evidence to suggest that the age of the subject has no
# influences their average score (p-value = 0.771).

```

# 2. Logistic regression

We will use the `sports.df` data set to conduct a simple logistic regression to answer the following research question:

> "Does the age influence the odds of living with a partner?"

Note that in this scenario, we will have one binary response variable (`partner = "Yes"`), and one (categorical) explanatory variable (`age`).

1. Create the response variable, named `partner_Yes`, and assign it within the `sports.df` data set.

```{r}
sports.df$partner_Yes = sports.df$partner == "Yes"
```

2. Fit the logistic regression model and interpret the output.

```{r}
partner_glm = glm(partner_Yes ~ age, data = sports.df, family = binomial)
summary(partner_glm)

# We have no evidence to suggest that the age has influence on 
# the odds of living with a partner (p-value = 0.1574).
```

We will use the `sports.df` data set again to conduct another simple logistic regression to answer the following research question:

> "Does the age group influence the odds of living with a partner?"

Note that in this scenario, we will have one binary response variable (`partner = "Yes"`), and one (categorical) explanatory variable (`age_group`).

3. Create the relevant frequency table. Do you expect a significant result?

```{r}
with(sports.df, table(partner_Yes, age_group))
```

4. Fit the logistic regression model and then use `anova(partner_glm, test="Chisq")` to test if `age_group` variable is a significant predictor.

```{r}
partner_glm = glm(partner_Yes ~ age_group, data = sports.df, family = binomial)
anova(partner_glm, test="Chisq")

# The result shows that age_group variable is not significant 
# predictor in predicting the odds of living with a partner 
```
