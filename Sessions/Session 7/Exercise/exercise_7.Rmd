```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = "#R: ")

gw = getwd()
setwd("../../../")
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
setwd(gw)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

For these exercises we will be using the `sports.df` data set again. Run the following lines to ensure you're up to date from the previous exercises:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
library(ggplot2)
```

# 1. Student's 2-sample t-test

We will conduct a 2-sample t-test to answer the following research question:
1. males and females have different mean `average` scores.

```{r}
t.test(average ~ gender, data = sports.df)
```

2. The mean `average` score of respondents living with their partners differs from that of respondents who do not live with their partners.

```{r}
t.test(average ~ partner, data = sports.df)
```

# 2. 1-way ANOVA

We will use the `sports.df` data set to conduct a 1-way ANOVA to answer the  following research question:

> "Does the average score different between age groups?"

Note that in this scenario, we (again) have one continuous variable (`average`) that has been taken on 3 independent samples (`age_group` variable: `Under 40`, `41 to 60` and `Over 61`). We wish to determine if there are any significant differences in the averages, therefore we will use a 1-way ANOVA. 

What are you expecting the results to show?

1. Conduct a one-way ANOVA using `aov`. Interpret the p-value.

```{r}
my_1way_aov = aov(average ~ age_group, data = sports.df)
summary(my_1way_aov)

# We have evidence to suggest that the average score is 
# different in one of the age groups (p-value = 0.0181).
```

2. Find the average BMI differences for each diet.

```{r}
model.tables(my_1way_aov, "means")
```

3. Perform pair-wise comparisons between all age group using Tukey's HSD to compute p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons. Which groups differ? Are you surprised?

```{r}
TukeyHSD(my_1way_aov)
```

# 3. 2-way ANOVA

We will use the `sports.df` data set to conduct a 2-way ANOVA to answer the following research question:

> "Does the average score differ between any of the age groups and/or genders?"

Note that all we will be doing to answer this question is adding one more variable (`gender`) to our 1-way ANOVA. We now have one continuous variable as our response variable (`average` score) and 2 grouping variables (`age_group` and `gender`), hence we will conduct a 2-way ANOVA.

1. Use `interaction.plot()`, to examine the response for two-way combinations of factors.

```{r}

with(sports.df, interaction.plot(age_group, gender, average))

```

Are you expecting a significant result?


3. Conduct a two-way ANOVA using `aov` with an interaction term. Do we have a significant interaction? Are you surprised?

```{r}
my_2way_aov = aov(average ~ age_group * gender, data = sports.df)
summary(my_2way_aov)

# We have no evidence to suggest that there is an interaction between 
# age groups and genders.
```

2. Find the average score for each age group and gender combination.

```{r}
model.tables(my_2way_aov, "means")
```

3. Perform pair-wise comparisons between all age group and gender combinations using Tukey's HSD to compute p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons. Which groups differ? Are you surprised?

```{r}
TukeyHSD(my_2way_aov)
```

If you have done enough exploratory work, you should never be surprised by your results.

# 4. Tests of independence

1. Produce a two-way frequency table of counts between `partner` and `gender`.

```{r}
partner_table = with(sports.df, table(partner, gender))
partner_table
```

2. Do you think that partnership status depends on gender? Perform an appropriate test to find out.

```{r}
chisq.test(partner_table)

# There is a strong evidence that artnership status depends on gender.
```
