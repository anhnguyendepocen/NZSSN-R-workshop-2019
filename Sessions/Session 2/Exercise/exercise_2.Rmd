```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = "#R: ")
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

sports.df = read.csv("../../../Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

For these exercises we will be using the `sports.df` data set again.

# 1. Calculate the standard error of the mean with base **R**

Using the conventional formula for the standard error of the mean (SEM) below, calculate the estimate of the SEM for the `age` of subjects from the survey.

$$
\hat{\mathrm{SEM}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where $s$ is the sample standard deviation (`sd()` function), and $n$ is the sample size (`length()` function).

```{r}
with(sports.df, sd(age) / sqrt(length(age)))
```

# 2. Calculate the standard error of the mean with the `plotrix` package

**R** packages are collections of user-defined functions. The function `std.error()`, for example, is a function that calculates the standard error of the mean (SEM), and is contained in the `plotrix` package.

1. Let's see what happens when we try to use a function within a package before that package has been installed and loaded. Try to calculate the SEM of the weight of the subjects in the diet study using the `std.error()` function.

```{r, error = TRUE}
std.error(sports.df$age)
```

**R** is telling us that it can't find the `std.error` function, because the `plotrix` package hasn't been installed and/or loaded.

2. Install the `plotrix` package:
  
    (a) Select the **Packages** tab from the bottom right panel of your Rstudio interface.
    
    (b) Click on the *Install* icon located just below the **Packages** tab.
    
    (c) Type `plotrix` in the blank space provided below the heading "*Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):*"
    
    (d) Select *No* if you are asked you to restart **R**.
    
    The `plotrix` package has now been installed on your computer, but we need to load the functions into our **R** session so **R** can find the `std.error` function:

    (e) Load the `plotrix` package using the code `library(plotrix)` to make 
    the functions contained in the `plotrix` package, available in the current **R** session.

```{r}
library(plotrix)
```

3. Now, use the `std.error` function to calculate the standard error of the mean weight (in pounds) of the subjects in our study.

```{r}
std.error(sports.df$age)
```

# 3. Subsetting datasets

1. Find the following:

- The age of the first subject.
    
```{r}
sports.df$age[1]
```

- The age of the last subject. Note, we can use the `nrow()` function to return the number of rows in the data set.
    
```{r}
sports.df$age[996]

# Or:
sports.df$age[nrow(sports.df)]

# Note: nrow() returns the number of rows in the data set
```

- The age of the first and last subject in our study.
    
```{r}
sports.df$age[c(1, 996)]

# Or:
sports.df$age[c(1, nrow(sports.df))]
```

- All measurements made on the third subject.
    
```{r}
sports.df[3, ]
```

- All of the subjects' ethnicities.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sports.df$ethnicity

# Or
sports.df[, 10]

# Or
sports.df[, "ethnicity"]
```

- How many females are there in the study?

```{r}
with(sports.df, length(which(gender == "Female")))

# Or
with(sports.df, sum(gender == "Female"))

```

2. Calculate:

- The average age of male subjects who were assigned to diet 1.

```{r}
with(sports.df, mean(age[gender == "Male"]))
```

- The median age of female subjects with no partner.

```{r}
with(sports.df, median(age[gender == "Female" & partner == "No"]))
```

# 4. `ifelse()` function 

1. Use the `ifelse()` function to fixed the `income` variable from `5 000$` to `< 5 000$`

```{r}
sports.df$income = with(sports.df, ifelse(income == "5 000$", "< 5 000$", income))
```

2. Using the `table()` function, check the frequency of `partner` variable in `sports.df`.

```{r} 
table(sports.df$partner)
```

3. Use the `ifelse()` function to clean up the `partner` variable: 

    + `NAP (married and living w legal spouse, Code 1 in MARITAL)` = "Yes"
    + `NA,refused` = NA

```{r}
sports.df$partner = 
  with(sports.df,
       ifelse(partner == "NAP (married and living w legal spouse, Code 1 in MARITAL)", "Yes",
              ifelse(partner == "NA,refused", NA, partner)))
```


4. Using nested `ifelse()` function, recode the `ethnicity` variable in `sports.df` dataset follow the table below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble(
    `Old ethnicity` = names(table(sports.df$ethnicity)),
   `New ethnicity` = c("Asian", "Euro", "Asian", "Maori", NA, "Other",
                      "Pacific")) %>% 
  kable( align = c("lr"))

```

```{r}
sports.df$ethnicity =
  with(sports.df, 
       ifelse(ethnicity == "China,Cantonese,Hakka,Mandarin", "Asian", 
              ifelse(ethnicity == "Europe,White/European", "Euro", 
                     ifelse(ethnicity == "India,Hindi,Urdu,Gujarati,Tamil", "Asian", 
                            ifelse(ethnicity == "Maori+New Zealand", "Maori", 
                                   ifelse(ethnicity == "NA, dont know", NA,
                                          ifelse(ethnicity == "Other,mixed origin", "Other",
                                                 "Pacific")))))))
```
