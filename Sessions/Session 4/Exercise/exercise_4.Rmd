```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = "#R: ")

gw = getwd()
setwd("../../../")
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
setwd(gw)
library(dplyr)
```

For these exercises we will be using the `sports.df` data set again. Run the following lines to ensure you're up to date from the previous exercises:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
```

# 1. Frequency tables

The easiest option for creating simple tables in base **R** is with the `table` function.

Use the `table` function to answer the following:

a. How many subjects are in each gender and age group combination?

```{r}
with(sports.df, table(age_group, gender))
```

b. How many subjects are in each gender of different ethnicities?

```{r}
with(sports.df, table(ethnicity, gender))
```

Let's see what happens if we try using the `table` function for more than 2 variables (i.e. a 3-way frequency table):

c. How many subjects are in each gender and age group combination, for different ethnicities?

```{r}
with(sports.df, table(age_group, gender, ethnicity))
```

# 2. Table of proportions

a. Calculate the column proportions for the frequency table in question 1a.

```{r}
with(sports.df, prop.table(table(age_group, gender), margin = 2))
```

b. Calculate the row proportions for the frequency table in question 1b.

```{r}
with(sports.df, prop.table( table(ethnicity, gender), margin = 1))
```


# 3. The pipe operator

The tables in the previous questions are only calculating 1 summary (either frequency or proportion). We can use the pipe operator when we want to calculate many different summaries for each group.

1. Use the pipe operator to answer question 1a. This problem can be summed up with the following quote:

>   "With my `sports.df` dataset,  
>    I want to group by the `age_group` and `gender` variables,  
>    calculate the frequency in each cell (`Freq = n()`),  
>    and spread the time points across the columns, with the frequencies in each cell."

```{r}
sports.df %>% 
  group_by(age_group, gender) %>% 
  summarize(Freq = n()) 
```

2. Turn the following quote into **R** code:

>   "With my `sports.df` dataset,  
>    I want to group by the `age_group`, `gender`, and `ethnicity` variables,  
>    and summarize the `average` score of the subjects,  
>    by calculating the frequency, average and standard deviation."

```{r}
sports.df %>% 
  group_by(age_group, gender, ethnicity) %>% 
  summarize(Freq = n(),
            Avg = mean(average),
            SD = sd(average))
```

Note that the frequency column is the same as the frequency table calculated in question 1c, but with the pipe operator we are also able to calculate other summaries for any other variable.

3. Create a summary table that is grouped by gender, partnership status and income, which contains the following summaries:

    + Frequency
    + Mean of age
    + Standard deviation of age
    + Median of `average` score
    + Variance of `average` score

```{r}
sports.df %>% 
  group_by(gender, partner, income) %>% 
  summarize(Freq = n(),
            Avg_age = mean(age),
            SD_age = sd(age),
            Med_Ave = median(average),
            Var_Ave = var(average))
```
