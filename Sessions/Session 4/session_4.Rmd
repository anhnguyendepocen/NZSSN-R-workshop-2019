## Session goals

- Pipe operator to simplify code (%>%)
- Summary tables

# Pipe operator (%>%)

## Pipe operator in **R**

The pipe operator (%>%):

- reduces the requirement of nested parentheses (functions within functions).
- orders the functional operations logically.
- simplifies **R** code and makes it easier to follow.

### RStudio shortcut: Ctrl-Shift-M

## Pipe operator: An example {data-transition="zoom-in none-out"}

> "With my `issp.df` dataset,  
> I want to group by the `gender` variable  
> and summarise `age`
> by calculating its mean and standard deviation."

> "With my `issp.df` dataset,

```{r, tidy = FALSE}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(age),
            SD = sd(total))
```


## Types of summaries

There are many different ways to summarise a variable, including:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(type = c("Continuous", "Continuous", "Discrete", "Discrete"),
           summary = c("Measure of centre", "Variability", "total", "Missing"),
           example = c("Mean, median", "Variance, SD, range, IQR",
                       "Percent, (relative) frequency", 
                       "Percent, (relative) frequency")) %>% 
  kable(format = "html", col.names = c("Variable", "Summary",  "Example")) %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)%>% 
  collapse_rows(columns = 1)
```

# Summary tables

## Measure of centre summaries

> "With my `issp.df` dataset, 
> I want to group by the `age_group` (`Under 35`, `36 to 60` and `Over 61`)  
> and summarise `total` score by calculating its mean and median."

```{r}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(age_group) %>% 
  summarise(Avg = mean(total),
            Median = median(total))
```

## Measure of variability summaries

> "With my `issp.df` dataset,
> I want to group by ethnicity (`Asian`, `Euro`, `Maori`, `Other` and `Pacific`)
> and summarise the variability of `total` score"

```{r, eval = FALSE}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(ethnicity) %>% 
  summarise(Freq = n(),
            Var = var(total),
            SD = sd(total),
            Min = min(total),
            Max = max(total),
            Range = Max - Min,
            IQR = IQR(total))
```

## Measure of variability summaries

> "With my `issp.df` dataset, 
> I want to group by ethnicity (`Asian`, `Euro`, `Maori`, `Other` and `Pacific`)
> and summarise the variability of `total` score"

```{r, echo = FALSE}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(ethnicity) %>% 
  summarise(Freq = n(),
            Var = var(total),
            SD = sd(total),
            Min = min(total),
            Max = max(total),
            Range = Max - Min,
            IQR = IQR(total))
```

## Grouping by more than 1 variable

> "With my `issp.df` dataset, 
> I want to group by `gender` and `age_group`   
> and summarise `working_hours_per_week` score 
> by calculating the mean."

```{r}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(gender, age_group) %>% 
  summarise(Avg = mean(working_hours_per_week))
```

# Frequency tables

## Frequency tables

Frequency tables are easy to calculate in base **R** with the `table` function:

```{r}
with(issp.df, table(gender))
```

We can also easily produce 2-way frequency tables:

```{r}
with(issp.df, table(gender, income))
```

## Table of proportions

We can wrap the `prop.table` function around the `table` function to produce a table of proportions:

```{r}
with(issp.df, prop.table(table(gender)))
```

## Table of proportions

We can wrap the `prop.table` function around the `table` function to produce a table of proportions:

```{r}
with(issp.df, prop.table(table(gender, income)))
```

Note that these proportions sum to 1.

## Table of row-wise and column-wise proportions

We can use the `margin` argument to specify if we want the rows (`margin = 1`) or columns (`margin = 2`) to add to 1.

```{r}
with(issp.df, prop.table(table(gender, income), margin = 1))
```

## Table of row-wise and column-wise proportions

We can use the `margin` argument to specify if we want the rows (`margin = 1`) or columns (`margin = 2`) to add to 1.

```{r}
with(issp.df, prop.table(table(gender, income), margin = 2))
```

## Frequency tables with the pipe operator

So far, we have seen how to easily produce frequency tables. We can also create frequency tables with the pipe operator:

```{r}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(gender, income) %>% 
  summarise(Freq = n()) 
```

## Larger summary tables {data-transition="zoom-in none-out"}

The real advantage of using the pipe operator for frequency tables is when you want to calculate many summaries and group by more than 2 variables:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(age_group, gender, income) %>%
  summarise(Freq = n(),
            avg_age = mean(age),
            avg_total = mean(total))
```

Here, we have 3 grouping variables (`age_group`, `gender`  and `income`), and we are calculating 4 summaries (frequency, average `age` and average `total` score).

## Larger summary tables {data-transition="zoom-out none-in"}

The real advantage of using the pipe operator for frequency tables is when you want to calculate many summaries and group by more than 2 variables:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(age_group, gender, income) %>%
  summarise(Freq = n(),
            avg_age = mean(age),
            avg_total = mean(total))
```

## Arrange {data-transition="none-out zoom-in"}

We can sort a table with the `arrange` function. For example, we can arrange the table by increasing average `age`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
issp.df %>% 
  group_by(age_group, gender, income) %>%
  summarise(Freq = n(),
            avg_age = mean(age),
            avg_total = mean(total)) %>% 
  arrange(avg_age)
```

We could have used `arrange(desc(avg_age))` to arrange by decreasing values.

## Arrange {data-transition="zoom-out none-in"}

We can sort a table with the `arrange` function. For example, we can arrange the table by increasing average `age`:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
issp.df%>% 
  group_by(age_group, gender, income) %>%
  summarise(Freq = n(),
            avg_age = mean(age),
            avg_total = mean(total)) %>% 
  arrange(avg_age)
```
