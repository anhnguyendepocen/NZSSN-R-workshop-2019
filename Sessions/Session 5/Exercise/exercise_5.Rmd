```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = "#R: ")

gw = getwd()
setwd("../../../")
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
setwd(gw)
library(dplyr)
```

For these exercises we will be using the `sports.df` data set again. Run the following lines to ensure you're up to date from the previous exercises:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
```

# 1. Histograms

With the `sports.df` data set, create histograms to show the distribution of the following variables:

1. Age
2. Average score

Remember to include informative titles and labels, ensure the y-axis text is oriented horizontally, and you have chosen an appropriate number of breaks.

```{r}
hist(sports.df$age, main = "Distribution of age",
     xlab = "Age (years)", las = 1)
```

```{r}
hist(sports.df$average, main = "Distribution of average score",
     xlab = "Height (cm)", las = 1)
```

# 2. Boxplots

1. With the `sports.df` data set, reproduce this boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot(average ~ age_group, data = sports.df,
        xlab = "Age Group", 
        ylab = "Average scores",
        main = "Average scores across age groups", las = 1)
```


# 3. Barplots

1. Create a bar plot showing the percentages of subjects in each of the age groups . Make the y-axis range from 0 to 40

```{r}
prop_table = with(sports.df, prop.table(table(age_group)))

barplot(prop_table * 100, las = 1, main = "Age group",  
        ylab = "Percent", ylim = c(0, 40))
```

2. Reproduce the following side-by-side bar plot that is created from a table of proportions for the age groups for each gender. 

    This can be created in 2 steps:

    1. Create a table of proportions for `age_group` and `gender`. Ensure that the columns sum to 1.
    2. Use `barplot()` to create the side-by-side bar plot, with appropriate arguments. Note the limits of the y axis are 0 and 40.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
prop_table = with(sports.df, 
                  prop.table(table(age_group, gender), margin = 2))

barplot(prop_table * 100,
        las = 1, main = "Age groups", beside = TRUE,
        ylab = "Percent", legend.text = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 40))
```

# 4. Scatter plots

1. Create a scatter plot to find out if there is any relationship between the 
Average score of the subject and how much their age changed. Remeber to include a meaningful title, labels, and ensure the y axis text is horizontal.

```{r}
with(sports.df, plot(age, average, main = "Average score vs Age",
                        ylab = "Average score", xlab = "Age",
                        las = 1))
```

2. Calculate the parameters needed to include a trend line to this plot using `lm`.

```{r}
trend_line = lm(average ~ age, data = sports.df)
trend_line
```

3. Finalize the scatter plot by adding the trend line.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
abline(trend_line)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
with(sports.df, plot(age, average, main = "Average score vs Age",
                        ylab = "Average score", xlab = "Age",
                        las = 1))
abline(trend_line)
```
