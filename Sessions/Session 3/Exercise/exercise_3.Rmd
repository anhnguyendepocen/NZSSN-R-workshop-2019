```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = "#R: ")

gw = getwd()
setwd("../../../")
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
source("Source/ex_2.R", encoding = 'UTF-8')
setwd(gw)

library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
```

For these exercises we will be using the `sports.df` data set again. Run the following 2 lines to ensure you're up to date from the previous exercises:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
source("Source/ex_2.R", encoding = 'UTF-8')
```

# 1. `factor`

1. Examine the `sports.df` dataset, and detemine which variables can be converted with factor without specify the order.

```{r} 
sports.df$gender = factor(sports.df$gender)
sports.df$partner = factor(sports.df$partner)
sports.df$ethnicity = factor(sports.df$ethnicity)
```

2. Check the freqnecy of `income` variable in `sports.df` and appropriately order its levels. 

```{r} 

table(sports.df$income)

sports.df$income = factor(sports.df$income, 
  levels = c("< 5 000$", "10 000$-15 000$", "15 000$-20 000$",
             "20 000$-25 000$", "25 000$-30 000$", "30 000$-40 000$",
             "40 000$-50 000$", "50 000$-70 000$", "70 000$-100 000$",
             "> 100 000$"))

table(sports.df$income)

```

3. Create a new variable into `sport.df` which categorises all subjects into one of three age groups: "Under 40", "41 to 60" and "Over 61" and convert this variable into factors with appropriate levels.


```{r}
age_group = 
  with(sports.df, ifelse(age <= 40, "Under 40",
                         ifelse(age > 40 &
                                  age <= 60, "41 to 60", "Over 61")))
age_group =
  factor(age_group, levels = c("Under 40", "41 to 60", "Over 61"))


sports.df$age_group = age_group
```



# 2. Combine data

Now you have another data set containing the questionnaire results called `sports questionnaire.csv`, and it contains 6 columns: 

- `id`: The unique subject ID (matches the subject ID from the initial data set).
- `q1a`-- `q1e`: Reponses from the questionnaire of each subject and presented as likert scales. 


1. Read in the `sports questionnaire.csv` data set into **R** and call it `mean.df`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("../../../")
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
setwd(gw)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

2. Ensure that the ID variables in both data sets are unique.

```{r}
anyDuplicated(sports.df$id)

anyDuplicated(mean.df$id)
```

3. Use a `full_join` to combine these 2 data sets. Have a look at the data by typing `View(sports.df)` into the console.

```{r}
sports.df = full_join(sports.df, mean.df, by = "id")

```


# 3. Create new variables

Calulate the average of the reponses from the questionnaire in the `sports.df` dataframe, and call it `average`.

```{r}
sports.df$average = 
  with(sports.df, (q1a + q1b + q1c + q1d + q1e)/5)
```

# 4. Finalise the dataset

Perform the listwise deletion of missing values to finalise `sports.df` dataset.

```{r}
sports.df = na.omit(sports.df)
```
