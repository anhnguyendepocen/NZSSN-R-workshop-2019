```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, comment = "#R: ")

gw = getwd()
setwd("../../../")
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
setwd(gw)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

For these exercises we will be using the `sports.df` data set again. Run the following lines to ensure you're up to date from the previous exercises:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sports.df = read.csv("Data/sports demographic.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
mean.df = read.csv("Data/sports questionnaire.csv")
source("Source/ex_3.R")
library(ggplot2)
```

Remember to always create informative axis labels and ensure your text is large enough to easily read.

Note, if there is no colour in a plot, the black and white theme (`theme_bw()`) is generally recommended.

# 1. Boxplot

Recreate the figure below. Note, you can suppress the x-axis title by adding
`axis.title.x = element_blank()` to the `theme` function.

```{r}
ggplot(sports.df, aes(age_group, average)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Average scores across age groups",
       y = "Average score") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

# 2. Scatterplot

1 Create a scatter plot using `ggplot()` to find out if there is any relationship between the age of the subject and how much their Average score changed. Make sure the plot includes:

- Meaningful labels and a title.
- Black and white theme.
- text size of 14 point.
- Trend line with a standard error region.

```{r}
ggplot(sports.df, aes(age, average)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Average scores vs age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Average scores") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))
```

# 3. Barplot

1. Create a bar plot using `ggplot()` showing the percentages of age group of subjects.

```{r}
ggplot(sports.df, 
       aes(age_group, y = ..prop.., group = 1)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Baseline BMI group",
       y = "Percent") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))
```

2. Reproduce the following side-by-side bar plot. Here are some hints:

- The bars are 70% opaque.
- Use `fill` instead of `colour` to define the grouping variable.
- The text size is 14 point.
- There is no x-axis title.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(sports.df, 
       aes(age_group, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge", alpha = .7) +
  labs(title = "BMI groups",
       y = "Frequency",
       fill = "Gender") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

# 4. Histogram

1. Create a histogram showing the distribution of age of subjects. Use the following parameters:

- Binwidth of 1.
- Alpha of 0.7 (70% opacity).
- Meaningful labels.
- Black and white theme.
- Text size of 14 point.

```{r}
ggplot(sports.df, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, alpha = .7) +
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))
```
